# LightsaberHilt
Code for a cutaway lightsaber with light-up kyber crystal

Upload the arduino code to an arduino with the setup from the design.  
When powered the LED will turn red. The LED has the following colors:  
* Red
* Green
* Blue
* Cyan
* Magenta
* Yellow
* Orange
* White
* Off

Color can be changed by pressing the button  

Hardware needed for lights:  
* Pushbutton
* 10k Ohm resistor
* Wires. At least 7
* RGB Led
* 3 220 Ohm resistors
* An Arduino. I'm using a Arduino Nano because it is small and wil fit in the hilt easier
* Power. I'm using a powerbank so it is rechargeable
